# Federated-Learning Using Flower

We have setup two clients named Client1 and Client2 which acts as two edge devices in which the federated model is been implemented and a Server where the modelâ€™s parameters are being sent to evaluate the performance and to update the global model on the server which is to be upgraded to each and every edge device connected to this server.

We have demonstrated both centralized and federated model for the MNIST and CIFAR datasets and have clearly shown the difference in performance, efficiency and accuracy between the centralized and federated learning models.
